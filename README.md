## 🔍 SGTL-DDA: Structurally-Aware Graph Transformer for DDA Prediction

**SGTL-DDA** is a novel graph transformer framework designed for predicting drug–disease associations (DDAs) from heterogeneous biological information networks (HBINs).

It incorporates both **structural information** and **domain-specific biological knowledge** through:

* 🧭 **Meta-path-guided sampling**: Extracts high-order semantic paths to capture complex biomedical relationships.
* 🧠 **Multi-level attention mechanism**: Integrates both structural dependencies and attribute-level features.
* 🔄 **End-to-end training**: Enables the model to jointly learn expressive drug and disease representations for accurate DDA prediction.

### 📌 Key Features

* Structure-aware representation learning
* Semantic path sampling across HBINs
* Dual-level attention fusion
* Support for drug repositioning and biomedical discovery
